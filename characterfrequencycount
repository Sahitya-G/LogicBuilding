Question:

Write a Java program that reads a string and calculates the frequency of each character in the string. The program should display each unique character along with its frequency.

Input:
A single line containing a string s, which may include uppercase and lowercase letters.
Output:
Print each unique character in the string followed by its frequency. Output each character and its frequency on a new line.

Constraints:
The input string will only contain alphabetic characters.
Characters are case-sensitive (e.g., 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters).



  Answer:

import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String s=sc.next();
		freq(s);

	}
	public static void freq(String s){
	    Map<Character,Integer> mp=new HashMap<>();
	    int n=s.length();
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
	        char c=s.charAt(i);
	        mp.put(c,1+mp.getOrDefault(c,0));
	    }
	    for(char p:mp.keySet()){
	        System.out.println(p+" "+mp.get(p));
	    }
	    
	}
}
